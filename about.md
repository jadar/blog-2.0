Jacob Rhoda is a disciple of Jesus Christ in his early 20s. 
He was educated at [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu) (BS, Class of '20), where he studied Comptuer Science. 
Jacob grew up in a covenant home and doesn't necessarily know a time when he didn't believe in Christ as his savior.
However, his faith became his own at the age of 13 when he entered into the covenant of church membership.
Jacob is currently a member of the [Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America](https://reformedpresbyterian.org).

Jacob is passionate about computer programming, Reformed theology, and reading books. Asking him about any of these
things is sure to generate hours of conversation.
